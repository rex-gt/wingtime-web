## Deployment & Environments

AeroBook Web supports four distinct environments to streamline development and testing.

### 1. Environment Overview

| Environment | Purpose | Target URL | Backend API | Trigger |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local** | Local Development | `http://localhost:5173` | `https://localhost:3000/api` | `npm run dev` |
| **Development** | Hosted Dev/Test | (Vercel Preview URL) | `...-api-staging.up.railway.app` | `npm run deploy:dev` |
| **Preview** | Shared Preview | `https://preview.aerobook.app/` | `...-api-staging.up.railway.app` | Push to `preview` branch |
| **Production** | Live Production | `https://aerobook.app/` | `...-api-production.up.railway.app` | Push to `main` branch |

### 2. Configuration (.env Files)

The project uses separate `.env` files for each environment. **Do not commit these files** (except for `.env.example`).

- `.env.local`: Local development settings.
- `.env.development`: Settings for the hosted Development environment.
- `.env.preview`: Settings for the Shared Preview environment.
- `.env.production`: Settings for the Live Production environment.

To sync your local environment variables to Vercel:
```bash
npm run env:sync
```

### 3. Deployment Workflow

We recommend using the interactive deployment menu for all manual pushes:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

#### Manual Commands:
- **Deploy to Development**: `npm run deploy:dev` (Manual CLI push)
- **Deploy to Production**: `npm run deploy:prod` (Manual CLI push)

#### Automated CI/CD:
- **Preview**: Push to the `preview` branch on GitHub to update `https://preview.aerobook.app/`.
- **Production**: Merge/Push to the `main` branch on GitHub to update `https://aerobook.app/`.
